// MARK: - Row Controls

/// Which of a row's subviews may have the click that landed on it.
///
/// `NSTableView` decides that in `validateProposedFirstResponder(_:for:)`, and its default answer
/// for a row that is **not already selected** is no: the table takes the click itself and selects
/// the row, so acting on the control needs a second one. That is the right gesture for a text
/// field — click to select the row, click again to edit — and the wrong one for a button, which
/// is why AppKit exempts its own `NSButton`s and why nothing about this was visible until this
/// app started building row buttons out of `ThemedControl`.
///
/// What it looked like: a session row's archive box did nothing at all, and its `⋯` opened "only
/// sometimes" — the sometimes being the row that happened to be selected already. Both clicks
/// were landing on the button, drawing its hover fill, and then being spent selecting the row
/// underneath, which also switched the session on screen and moved the sidebar's focus ring. The
/// three reports were one bug.
///
/// Stated as a rule about *controls that act on their own click*, not a list of classes: every
/// `ThemedControl` in this app is one (button, toggle, chip, pop-up, recorder — no text editor
/// among them), and `NSButton` covers AppKit's own, including the disclosure triangle an outline
/// view inserts. A label, an image or the row's ground is none of these, so clicking a row
/// anywhere else still selects it — "anywhere else" meaning outside every such control, the glyphs
/// and labels *inside* one included, for the reason `takesItsOwnClick` states.

    /// what it hit is not what the user aimed at. `ThemedIconButton` draws its glyph in a child
    /// view (a `GlyphView`; an `NSImageView` when this was found), so the proposed responder over
    /// an archive box is that child — which AppKit does not exempt — and the table went on vetoing the click in the
    /// middle of a button it had just been taught to allow. What survived was the four-point
    /// padding ring around the glyph, which is why this was reported twice and differently: the `⋯`
    /// "worked, but nowhere near always" because an ellipsis is 9 points tall in a 20-point target
    /// and leaves live bands above and below it, while the archive box was "basically impossible"
    /// because `archivebox` is 12×16 and fills nearly all of the same target. Both are one glyph
    /// in the way, measured as a 16-point-wide dead centre.
